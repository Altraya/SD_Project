# SD_Project
Distributed System project for S6. We need to create a multiplatform program who allow us to keep control of an other computer.

Use : 

	- JNativeHook : It is a library to provide global keyboard and mouse listeners for Java. This will allow you to listen for global shortcuts or mouse motion that would otherwise be impossible using pure Java.
	- Xtest : A library for test
